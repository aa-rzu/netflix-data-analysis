# 🎬 Netflix Data Analysis & Recommendation System

This project explores the Netflix dataset using Python — from cleaning and visualization to building a mini recommendation engine based on show descriptions.

## 🔍 What I Did

- 📊 Performed exploratory data analysis on Netflix titles dataset
- 🧹 Cleaned missing values and standardized inconsistent entries
- 📈 Visualized:
  - Distribution of Movies vs TV Shows
  - Top content-producing countries
  - Most popular genres
  - Content added over the years
- 🤖 Built a content-based recommendation system using:
  - `TF-IDF` Vectorizer (from `scikit-learn`)
  - Cosine similarity on show descriptions

---

## 📦 Tools Used

- Python (Colab)
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn (`TfidfVectorizer`, `cosine_similarity`)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
2. Upload the [`netflix_titles.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows) dataset
3. Run each cell to see visualizations and test the recommendation system
